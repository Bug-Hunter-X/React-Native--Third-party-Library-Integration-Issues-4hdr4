This error occurs when using a third-party library that has not been properly configured or integrated with React Native. This can happen due to incorrect installation, missing dependencies, or version mismatches. For example, if you are using a library that requires native modules and those modules haven't been properly linked, then the app might crash or behave unpredictably.  Another common problem is when a library expects a specific version of React Native which your project doesn't meet.  This often manifests as runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or even build failures.
