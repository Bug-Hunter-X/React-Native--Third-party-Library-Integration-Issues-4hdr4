# React Native Third-Party Library Integration Issues

This repository demonstrates a common but often difficult-to-diagnose error in React Native applications: problems stemming from improper integration of third-party libraries.

The bug is caused by a missing native module in a hypothetical image loading library.

## Bug
The `ThirdPartyLibraryBug.js` file contains the erroneous code that attempts to use the library without ensuring the native module is correctly linked.  Running this code will result in a runtime crash or unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The `ThirdPartyLibrarySolution.js` file shows the corrected implementation, demonstrating how to properly link the native module (or address other related version/dependency issues) and resolve the error.  This often involves making changes to your project's configuration files (like `android/app/build.gradle` or `ios/Podfile`) and possibly running additional build commands.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies (if any).
3. Attempt to run the `ThirdPartyLibraryBug.js` code â€“ you should encounter an error.
4. Replace the problematic code with the contents of `ThirdPartyLibrarySolution.js` and observe the corrected behavior.

## Note
The specifics of the solution (e.g., linking steps for native modules) will depend heavily on the third-party library in question. Consult its documentation for guidance.  This example illustrates a general pattern of such errors.
